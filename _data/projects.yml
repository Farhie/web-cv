            an incredibly slow release cycle and poor  with an ever increasing Due to reliance on a legacy system the retailer had been

  title: 100% Digital Loan Product
  tagline: "Worked with a multinational bank to build their first continuous delivery project, a 100% digital consumer loans 
            product. We built Java 8 Dropwizard micro services, a continuous delivery process in Jenkins that builds Openshift gears and 
            deploys them using Bash, which was later moved to Ruby. Our process deploys to the internal private cloud based on Red Hat Openshift.

  title: Replatforming ScienceDirect.com
  tagline: "Contributed to the replatforming of one of the words largest scientific journal and book platforms. The 15 year old 
            legacy platform suffered from many issues, including high levels of downtime (48 hours a year), poor performance (three second 
            page load times), a slow release cycle (nine months for a significant feature) and high levels of defects within each release. 
            <br> We worked with the client development team to deliver a scalable, highly available, multi region infrastructure on AWS, using 
            Ansible for orchestration. Java 8 and NodeJS micro services allowed us to slowly strangle functionality out of the old system. 
            Python was used for scripting deployment and GoCD for continuous integration. Working with the client allowed them to move from 
            an offshore IT department into a local, agile team delivering a performant, resilient and flexible platform that can adapt to 
            changing user demands."
